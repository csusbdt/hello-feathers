==============

Simple project to build and test an application written with Feathers/Starling.

Good tutorial: http://www.senocular.com/flash/tutorials/as3withmxmlc/

## iOS Notes

Apple developer website is at developer.apple.com

Create an iOS developers account ($99 per year).

Create an iOS developer certificate.

Create an app id that matches the app id in the application.xml (I believe.)
Create a provisioning profile for the app to run on the device.

Run Xcode to manage installation of provisioning profile to device.
In XCode, open Window ... Organizer.
Connect by USB a device and set it as a developer device.
Add the provisioning profile that you created for it. 

Install the app.
